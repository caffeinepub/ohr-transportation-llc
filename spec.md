# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Increase interactivity and user feedback across the Ohr Transportation LLC site while keeping motion tasteful and performance-friendly.

**Planned changes:**
- Add micro-interactions and motion across Home, Quote, Booking, and Tracking (hover/focus/press states; scroll-triggered entrance animations; subtle SPA page transitions).
- Upgrade Home “Our Services” cards into an interactive details experience (open an accessible in-page details view; include richer service info; provide CTA to Quote/Booking with the selected service pre-selected).
- Improve Quote and Booking form interactivity (real-time validation hints, clear inline errors, visible handling for backend failures, and non-blocking success feedback).
- Enhance Tracking results UX (copy shipment ID with confirmation feedback; expandable/collapsible history entries; loading skeleton for results area).

**User-visible outcome:** The site feels more responsive and interactive, with smoother navigation and animations, richer service exploration from the Home page, clearer form guidance and error/success messaging on Quote/Booking, and more usable tracking results (copy ID, expandable entries, skeleton loading).
